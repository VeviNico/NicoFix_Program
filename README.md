The NicoFix-Tool is a lightweight program that performs the following system checks on Windows. 
The program verifies whether Windows Security is active, confirms the presence of antivirus protection detects connected webcams and microphones, identifies the type of network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and present a visual summary to help users understand their system’s security status.
By consolidating all features into simple and user-friendly interface, the tool helps users understand their current system security settings. 
It also encourages them to act, such as turning on security features or installing antivirus software if needed. At the same time, it raises awareness about basic digital safety.

Demonstration and walkthrough of the NicoFix Tool
This section presents a step-by-step walkthrough of the Tool, demonstrating its functionality and features in action. Screenshots and explanations are provided to show how the tool operates, checks the system and displays results to the user.

The NicoFix System & Security Tool is a program that is launched by double clicking its executable file, as shown below.
 
Once launched, the user is presented with a clean simple interface designed for easy navigation. The main window includes clear sections for system checks such as Firewall, Antivirus, Webcam, Microphone, Network and Windows Update status. 
Each feature has a corresponding indicator light and an option to access additional system tools.
This design ensures that users of all skill levels can quickly understand their system’s current status and act if needed.

Design considerations
The tool was built using Python, with a user-friendly graphical interface designed to appeal to both younger and older audiences. 
The dark-themed window with blue-highlighted buttons improves contrast and makes the tool easier to navigate, especially for users with limited technical experience. 
The status indicators provide clear, color-coded feedback – green signaling active and secure settings, red indicating issues requiring attention – along with descriptive labels such “Firewall: Active” or “Antivirus: Not Detected” to ensure clarity.
These design choices aim to create a tool that is not only functional but also visually accessible and easy to use, empowering non-technical users to take control of their digital security.
 
Impact and relevance
The NicoFix Tool demonstrates how a practical cybersecurity solution can empower users especially those in vulnerable groups to take responsibility for their own safety. 
It complements the theoretical aspects of this project by offering a real-world example of how simple tools can address common cybersecurity challenges faced by non-technical users.
This tool was evaluated in a Windows environment (Norwegian OS) and adjusted to work properly with local system settings where possible. Its development followed a step-by-step, problem-solving approach, with the code adapted to manage system differences and meet user needs.
The NicoFix Tool serves as a practical and user-friendly application designed to assist non-technical users especially seniors and children in understanding and managing their computer basic security settings. 
By providing clear feedback, actionable suggestions and an intuitive interface, the tool contributes to the project’s broader goal of improving cybersecurity awareness among vulnerable groups. 
The tool’s development highlights the importance of creating accessible solutions that bridge the gap between technical knowledge and real-world applications, aligning with the project’s focus on digital safety for all users.
The development of the NicoFix -Tool (NicoFix System & Security Tool) was supported by learning from the official Python documentation, which provided guidance on coding structure, libraries and best practices (Python documentation, 2025).
 
Future improvements
Future improvements for NicoFix Tool could include the development of a basic user guide or README file to provide clear instructions for users. 
The tool could be expanded to include additional system checks, such as Windows Update, device drivers and hardware condition indicators. 
Adding support for multiple languages would make the tool more accessible to a wider range of users. Enhancing the error-handling system could improve its stability and reliability. 
Additionally, signing the executable file with a verified certificate would help build user trust and improve security when sharing the tool externally.
